Implement: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these principles:

1. **State your approach first** — explain what you'll do and why, in 3-5 bullet points, before writing any code
2. **KISS** — simplest solution that works. No over-engineering, no premature abstractions, no speculative features
3. **Idiomatic** — follow the conventions already in this codebase (language, framework, naming, structure)
4. **Senior-level quality** — clean, readable, well-structured. No TODO comments, no dead code, no half-measures
5. **Minimal surface area** — change only what's needed. Don't refactor surrounding code, don't add unrelated improvements

Read relevant existing code first to understand patterns before implementing. If something is unclear, ask rather than guess.
