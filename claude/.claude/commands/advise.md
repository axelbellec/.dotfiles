Advise on: $ARGUMENTS

Provide a structured analysis:

1. **Context** — restate the decision and why it matters. Read relevant code or docs first to ground your analysis in reality
2. **Options** — list 2-4 realistic options (not strawmen)
3. **Analysis** — for each option: pros, cons, effort, risk, and long-term implications
4. **Recommendation** — pick one option and explain why. Be opinionated — a clear recommendation with reasoning is more useful than a balanced "it depends"
5. **Next steps** — concrete actions to move forward with the recommendation

Consider: team velocity, maintenance burden, reversibility, and what you'd do if this were your own codebase.
