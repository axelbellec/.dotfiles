Document: $ARGUMENTS

Write documentation for a developer audience:

1. **Read first** — read the code/component and any existing documentation before writing anything
2. **Match existing style** — if there's already a doc style in this repo, follow it
3. **Include**:
   - What it does (purpose, not implementation details)
   - How to use it (with concrete examples)
   - Configuration or parameters
   - Edge cases or gotchas worth knowing
4. **Skip the obvious** — don't document what the code already says clearly
5. **Keep it maintainable** — prefer short, accurate docs over comprehensive ones that will go stale
